React
    Library for creating UI
    Composition of components
    component = encapsulation of Presentation + UI Behavior + State
    Responsibility of a component is to synchronize the state changes in the UI

react.js
react-dom.js
babel.js


State
    1. UI State
        Data that supports the "Presentational" needs of the application
        Highly unlikely that this data is needed in other parts of the application
        Feel free to maintain this in the compnent using the 'useState' hook

    2. App State
        Data that supports the "Business Logic" needs of the application
        Highly LIKELY that this data is needed in other parts of the application
        DONOT maintain this data in the component
